                        RTMP Errata and Addenda

Abstract

   The specification for Adobe's Real-Time Messaging Protocol (RTMP),
   last updated in December 2012, contains errors, omissions, and
   ambiguities that impede interoperation.  This memo corrects,
   clarifies, and amends portions of the RTMP specification.

1.  Introduction

   At the time of writing, Adobe's Real-Time Messaging Protocol (RTMP)
   continues to be used by the media streaming industry and in media
   streaming products for transmitting live video and audio over IP
   networks, including between and through various stages of live video
   production, ingest, and distribution.

   The RTMP specification [RTMP] was last updated by Adobe in December
   2012.  That version contains numerous errors, omissions, and
   ambiguities that impede the independent development of correct and
   interoperable live streaming products.

   At the time of writing, the RTMP specification is considered to be an
   immutable historical artifact.  This memo is intended to be
   referenced alongside [RTMP] to correct, clarify, and amend portions
   of the historical specification.

   This memo addresses RTMP Version 3 as publicly described in [RTMP].
   It does not address private or undocumented extensions for which
   interoperation is not desired by the extending parties.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Common Syntax Elements

   Definitions of types and structures in this specification use
   traditional text diagrams paired with procedural descriptions using a
   C-like syntax.  The C-like procedural descriptions SHALL be construed
   as definitive.

   Structures are packed to take only as many bytes as explicitly
   indicated.  There is no 32-bit alignment constraint, and fields are
   not padded for alignment unless explicitly indicated or described.
   Text diagrams may include a bit ruler across the top; this is a
   convenience for counting bits in individual fields and does not
   necessarily imply field alignment on a multiple of the ruler width.

   Unless specified otherwise, reserved fields SHOULD be set to 0 by a
   sender and MUST be ignored by a receiver.

   The procedural syntax of this specification defines correct and
   error-free encoded inputs to a parser.  The procedural syntax does
   not describe a fully featured parser, including error detection and
   handling.  Implementations MUST include means to identify error
   circumstances, including truncations causing elementary or composed
   types not to fit inside containing structures, fields, or elements.
   Unless specified otherwise, an error circumstance SHALL abort the
   parsing and processing of an element and its enclosing elements.

   This memo uses the elementary types and constructs described in
   Section 2.1.1 of [RFC7016].  The definitions of that section are
   incorporated by reference as though fully set forth here.

2.1.  Additional Elementary Types

   This section lists additional elementary types used in the following
   sections.

   uint24_t var;
      An unsigned integer 24 bits (3 bytes) in length, in network byte
      order and byte aligned.

   uint16le_t var;
      An unsigned integer 16 bits (2 bytes) in length, in little-endian
      byte order and byte aligned.

   uint32le_t var;
      An unsigned integer 32 bits (4 bytes) in length, in little-endian
      byte order and byte aligned.

3.  Byte Order

   Section 4 of [RTMP] states that "all integer fields are carried in
   network byte order".  However, there are two exceptions in the
   specification where multi-byte integers are coded in little-endian
   byte order.  To draw attention to these exceptions and to eliminate
   the dissonance between the exceptions and the statement, the first
   two sentences of that section are amended to read

   |  Unless otherwise specified, multi-byte integer fields are carried
   |  in network byte order, byte zero is the first byte shown, and bit
   |  zero is the most significant bit in a word or field.  This byte
   |  order is commonly known as "big-endian".

3.1.  Chunk Basic Header

   Section 5.3.1.1 of [RTMP] describes the one, two, and three byte
   encodings of the Chunk Basic Header.  The descriptive text gives a
   formula to decode the three-byte encoding as though the "cs id - 64"
   field is little-endian; however, this is not explicitly stated and is
   easy to miss given the diagrams and the description of the field as
   just "8 or 16 bits".  This section clarifies the Chunk Basic Header
   encodings.

       uintn_t fmt                      :2; // format
       uintn_t provisionalChunkStreamID :6;
       if (provisionalChunkStreamID >= 2)
           chunkStreamID = provisionalChunkStreamID; // one-byte form
       else
       {
           if (0 == provisionalChunkStreamID)
               uint8_t chunkStreamIDMinus64; // two-byte form
           else // 1 == provisionalChunkStreamID
               uint16le_t chunkStreamIDMinus64; // three-byte form
           chunkStreamID = chunkStreamIDMinus64 + 64;
       }
   } :variable*8;

   The chunkStreamIDMinus64 field of the 3-byte form encodes the chunk
   stream ID less 64 in little-endian byte order.

3.2.  Chunk Message Header

   Section 5.3.1.2 of [RTMP] describes the four Chunk Message Header
   formats.  The format being used is indicated by the fmt field of the
   Chunk Basic Header.

   The Type 0 Chunk Message Header format includes the RTMP Message
   Stream ID.  The description of the Message Stream ID (4 bytes) field
   in Section 5.3.1.2.5 of [RTMP] specifies that the field "is stored in
   little-endian format".  However, the diagram doesn't show this and it
   is easily missed.  This section clarifies the Type 0 Chunk Message
   Header format.

    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7|0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7|0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7|0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7

   struct chunkMessageHeaderType0_t {
       uint24_t provisionalTimestamp;
       uint24_t messageLength;
       uint8_t messageTypeID;
       uint32le_t messageStreamID;

       if (0xFFFFFF == provisionalTimestamp)
       {
           uint32_t extendedTimestamp;
           timestamp = extendedTimestamp;
       }
       else
           timestamp = provisionalTimestamp;
   } :variable*8;

   The messageStreamID field encodes the message stream ID as four bytes
   in little-endian byte order.  Note however that per Section 5 the
   message stream ID SHOULD NOT exceed 16777215.

4.  Timestamps

4.1.  Chunk Message Header Extended Timestamp

   Section 5.3.1.2 of [RTMP] implies that the Extended Timestamp field
   is separate from the Chunk Message Header.  This implication is
   misleading because, when it is present, it is in fact part of the
   chunk header and does not count toward the chunk's payload or the
   Message Length.  Because of this, all four types of Chunk Message
   Header should be recognized as being variable-length.

   While Section 5.3.1.3 of [RTMP] states that the Extended Timestamp is
   present in Type 3 chunks when the most recent Type 0, Type 1, or Type
   2 chunk for the same Chunk Stream ID indicated the presence of an
   extended timestamp, this has caused confusion for some implementors
   for the Type 3 chunks that are the subsequent portions of the same
   message, or that are the first chunk of subsequent messages.  To
   clarify: when the Extended Timestamp field is indicated, it MUST be
   present in _every_ Type 3 Chunk Message Header for a message,
   including the first as well as subsequent chunks of that message _and
   subsequent messages starting with Type 3_, even though this is
   wasteful.

4.2.  Timestamp Order of Messages

5.  RTMP Message Format

   Section 6.1 of [RTMP] defines the RTMP Message Format, with an
   explicit encoding of the RTMP message header including field widths
   and byte ordering.  However, this definition is misleading because
   RTMP messages are not serialized according to this format over either
   of the common transports.  For example, when RTMP messages are
   transported by the RTMP Chunk Stream, RTMP message headers are
   encoded into Chunk Message Headers; and when RTMP messages are
   transported in RTMFP according to Section 5.1 of [RFC7425], RTMP
   message headers are encoded into flow metadata and the leading bytes
   of flow user messages.  Therefore, the Message Header of the RTMP
   Message Format SHOULD be construed as a _virtual_ or _semantic_
   header that is mapped to the facilities of a lower-layer transport
   protocol such as RTMP Chunk Stream or RTMFP.

   The semantics of the RTMP Message Virtual Header and the encodings
   used in the common transport protocols constrain the possible values
   of RTMP Message Header fields.  In particular:

   *  Message Type is constrained to values from 0 to 255 inclusive;

   *  Message payloads can be at most 16777215 bytes long;

   *  Timestamps range from 0 to 4294967295 and wrap around;



Thornburgh                    Informational                     [Page 6]

                         RTMP Errata and Addenda               June 2023


   *  Stream ID is constrained to values from 0 to 16777215 inclusive.

   Note that in some cases these constraints are more restrictive than
   the facilities provided by lower-layer transports.  For example, RTMP
   Chunk Stream could encode a Stream ID up to 4294967295; RTMFP could
   encode a Stream ID of any finite non-negative integer (though typical
   implementations are limited to 2^64 - 1) and transport messages of
   unlimited length.  However, exceeding the limits enumerated above
   will impede interoperability and protocol translation, so they SHOULD
   NOT be exceeded.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This memo has no IANA actions.

7.  Security Considerations

   RTMP and RTMFP URIs use the generic syntax for URIs [RFC3986].  URIs
   can encode sensitive or private information such as user names,
   passwords, stream names, and so on.  Implementations SHOULD remove
   any userinfo and fragment components of a URI before sending it as
   the tcUrl member of the connect command's Command Object or in the
   Ancillary Data option of an RTMFP Endpoint Discriminator
   (Section 4.4.2.2 of [RFC7425]).
