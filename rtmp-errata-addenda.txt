                        RTMP Errata and Addenda

Abstract

   The specification for Adobe's Real-Time Messaging Protocol (RTMP),
   last updated in December 2012, contains errors, omissions, and
   ambiguities that impede interoperation.  This memo corrects,
   clarifies, and amends portions of the RTMP specification.

1.  Introduction

   At the time of writing, Adobe's Real-Time Messaging Protocol (RTMP)
   continues to be used by the media streaming industry and in media
   streaming products for transmitting video and audio over IP networks,
   including between and through various stages of live video
   production, ingest, and distribution.

   The RTMP specification [RTMP] was last updated by Adobe in December
   2012.  That version contains numerous errors, omissions, and
   ambiguities that impede the independent development of correct and
   interoperable streaming products.

   At the time of writing, the RTMP specification is considered to be an
   immutable historical artifact.  This memo is intended to be
   referenced alongside [RTMP] to correct, clarify, and amend portions
   of that historical specification.

   This memo addresses RTMP Version 3 as publicly described in [RTMP].
   It does not address private or undocumented extensions for which
   interoperation is not desired by the extending parties.

   For coordinated interoperable extensions and enhancements to RTMP,
   see Enhancing RTMP, FLV With Additional Video Codecs and HDR Support
   [E-RTMP].

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Common Syntax Elements

   Definitions of types and structures in this specification use
   traditional text diagrams paired with procedural descriptions using a
   C-like syntax.  The C-like procedural descriptions SHALL be construed
   as definitive.

   Structures are packed to take only as many bytes as explicitly
   indicated.  There is no 32-bit alignment constraint, and fields are
   not padded for alignment unless explicitly indicated or described.
   Text diagrams may include a bit ruler across the top; this is a
   convenience for counting bits in individual fields and does not
   necessarily imply field alignment on a multiple of the ruler width.

   Unless specified otherwise, reserved fields SHOULD be set to 0 by a
   sender and MUST be ignored by a receiver.

   The procedural syntax of this specification defines correct and
   error-free encoded inputs to a parser.  The procedural syntax does
   not describe a fully featured parser, including error detection and
   handling.  Implementations MUST include means to identify error
   circumstances, including truncations causing elementary or composed
   types not to fit inside containing structures, fields, or elements.
   Unless specified otherwise, an error circumstance SHALL abort the
   parsing and processing of an element and its enclosing elements.

   This memo uses the elementary types and constructs described in
   Section 2.1.1 of [RFC7016].  The definitions of that section are
   incorporated by reference as though fully set forth here.

2.1.  Additional Elementary Types

   This section lists additional elementary types used in the following
   sections.

   uint24_t var;
      An unsigned integer 24 bits (3 bytes) in length, in network byte
      order and byte aligned.





Thornburgh                    Informational                     [Page 3]

                         RTMP Errata and Addenda               June 2023


   uint16le_t var;
      An unsigned integer 16 bits (2 bytes) in length, in little-endian
      byte order and byte aligned.

   uint32le_t var;
      An unsigned integer 32 bits (4 bytes) in length, in little-endian
      byte order and byte aligned.

3.  Byte Order

   Section 4 of [RTMP] states that "all integer fields are carried in
   network byte order".  However, there are two exceptions in the
   specification where multi-byte integers are coded in little-endian
   byte order.  To draw attention to these exceptions and to eliminate
   the dissonance between the exceptions and the statement, the first
   two sentences of that section are amended to read

   |  Unless otherwise specified, multi-byte integer fields are carried
   |  in network byte order, byte zero is the first byte shown, and bit
   |  zero is the most significant bit in a word or field.  This byte
   |  order is commonly known as "big-endian".

3.1.  Chunk Basic Header

   Section 5.3.1.1 of [RTMP] describes the one, two, and three byte
   encodings of the Chunk Basic Header.  The descriptive text gives a
   formula to decode the three-byte encoding as though the "cs id - 64"
   field is little-endian; however, this is not explicitly stated and is
   easy to miss given the diagrams and the description of the field as
   just "8 or 16 bits".  This section clarifies the Chunk Basic Header
   encodings.

   struct chunkBasicHeader_t {
       uintn_t fmt                      :2; // format
       uintn_t provisionalChunkStreamID :6;
       if (provisionalChunkStreamID >= 2)
           chunkStreamID = provisionalChunkStreamID; // one-byte form
       else
       {
           if (0 == provisionalChunkStreamID)
               uint8_t chunkStreamIDMinus64; // two-byte form
           else // 1 == provisionalChunkStreamID
               uint16le_t chunkStreamIDMinus64; // three-byte form
           chunkStreamID = chunkStreamIDMinus64 + 64;
       }
   } :variable*8;

   The chunkStreamIDMinus64 field of the 3-byte form encodes the chunk
   stream ID less 64 in little-endian byte order.

3.2.  Chunk Message Header

   Section 5.3.1.2 of [RTMP] describes the four Chunk Message Header
   formats.  The format being used is indicated by the fmt field of the
   Chunk Basic Header.

   The Type 0 Chunk Message Header format includes the RTMP Message
   Stream ID.  The description of the Message Stream ID (4 bytes) field
   in Section 5.3.1.2.5 of [RTMP] specifies that the field "is stored in
   little-endian format".  However, the diagram doesn't show this and it
   is easily missed.  This section clarifies the Type 0 Chunk Message
   Header format.

   struct chunkMessageHeaderType0_t {
       uint24_t   provisionalTimestamp;
       uint24_t   messageLength;
       uint8_t    messageTypeID;
       uint32le_t messageStreamID;

       if (0xFFFFFF == provisionalTimestamp)
       {
           uint32_t extendedTimestamp;
           timestamp = extendedTimestamp;
       }
       else
           timestamp = provisionalTimestamp;
   } :variable*8;

   The messageStreamID field encodes the message stream ID as four bytes
   in little-endian byte order.  Note however that per Section 6 the
   message stream ID SHOULD NOT exceed 16777215.

4.  Timestamps

4.1.  Chunk Message Header Extended Timestamp

   Section 5.3.1.2 of [RTMP] implies that the Extended Timestamp field
   is separate from the Chunk Message Header.  This implication is
   misleading because, when it is present, it is in fact part of the
   chunk header and does not count toward the chunk's payload or the
   Message Length.  Because of this, all four types of Chunk Message
   Header should be recognized as being variable-length.

   While Section 5.3.1.3 of [RTMP] states that the Extended Timestamp is
   present in Type 3 chunks when the most recent Type 0, Type 1, or Type
   2 chunk on the same Chunk Stream ID indicated the presence of an
   extended timestamp, this has caused confusion for some implementors
   for the Type 3 chunks that are the subsequent portions of the same
   message, or that are the first chunk of subsequent messages on the



Thornburgh                    Informational                     [Page 6]

                         RTMP Errata and Addenda               June 2023


   same Chunk Stream ID.  To clarify: while the Extended Timestamp field
   is indicated, it MUST be present in _every_ Type 3 Chunk Message
   Header for a message, including the first as well as subsequent
   chunks of that message _and subsequent messages starting with Type
   3_, even though this is wasteful.

4.2.  Timestamp Order of Messages

   Section 5 of [RTMP] states

   |  When used with a reliable transport protocol such as TCP
   |  [RFC0793], RTMP Chunk Stream provides guaranteed timestamp-ordered
   |  end-to-end delivery of all messages, across multiple streams.

   However, this wording is misleading.  For example, Section 5.3.1.2.1
   of [RTMP] alludes to a case where "the stream timestamp goes backward
   (e.g. because of a backward seek)".  Note that RTMP can be used for
   Video on Demand (VOD) and Digital Video Recorder (DVR) playback as
   well as for live streaming.

   Senders MAY apply real-time treatments to RTMP messages, including
   prioritization policies and transmission deadlines.  Prioritization
   can include (but is not limited to) preferential allocation of
   transmission resources to audio over video, or to one stream over
   another.  Prioritization can cause, for example, later audio messages
   to be transmitted before earlier video messages.

   Senders have full control over scheduling, interleaving, and
   transmitting RTMP messages, or portions thereof, over lower-layer
   transports.  When using RTMP Chunk Stream over a reliable, in-order
   transport protocol such as TCP [RFC0793], a sender can ensure
   delivery of messages in any desired order, including in timestamp
   order.

   For optimum interoperability with straightforward implementations and
   with many existing implementations, timestamps SHOULD NOT go
   backwards in the same Message Stream ID for the same RTMP Message
   Type ID without an explicit signal from the receiver (such as
   initiating a backward seek) indicating such a jump is expected.

5.  Abandoning a Message

   Section 5.4.2 of [RTMP] describes the Abort Message Protocol Control
   Message.  The description of this message states

   |  An application may send this message when closing in order to
   |  indicate that further processing of the messages is not required.




Thornburgh                    Informational                     [Page 7]

                         RTMP Errata and Addenda               June 2023


   This description is misleading, and suggests that receipt of this
   message signals that no further processing of any messages is
   required, which is incorrect.

   This protocol control message aborts a single partially-transmitted
   message on the indicated Chunk Stream ID.  Afterward, new messages
   can commence on the same Chunk Stream ID.

   Senders can apply real-time treatments to messages, including
   transmission deadlines.  A message's transmission deadline might be
   exceeded after transmission has started but before transmission is
   complete.  Therefore, receivers MUST be operable to process the Abort
   Message Protocol Control Message by discarding the partially-received
   message and being prepared to receive a new message on the indicated
   Chunk Stream ID.

   If at least one chunk for a new message is transmitted, then a
   timestamp is established for that message against which a timestamp
   delta in a subsequent message can be applied, even if the first
   message is aborted.

6.  RTMP Message Format

   Section 6.1 of [RTMP] defines the RTMP Message Format, with an
   explicit encoding of the RTMP message header including field widths
   and byte ordering.  However, this definition is misleading because
   RTMP messages are not serialized according to this format over either
   of the common transports.  For example, when RTMP messages are
   transported by the RTMP Chunk Stream, RTMP message headers are
   encoded into Chunk Message Headers; and when RTMP messages are
   transported in RTMFP according to Section 5.1 of [RFC7425], RTMP
   message headers are encoded into flow metadata and the leading bytes
   of flow user messages.  Therefore, the Message Header of the RTMP
   Message Format SHOULD be construed as a _virtual_ header that is
   mapped to the facilities of a lower-layer transport protocol such as
   RTMP Chunk Stream or RTMFP.

   The semantics of the RTMP Message Virtual Header and the encodings
   used in the common transport protocols constrain the possible values
   of RTMP Message Header fields.  In particular:

   *  Message Type is constrained to values from 0 to 255 inclusive;

   *  Message payloads can be at most 16777215 bytes long;

   *  Timestamps range from 0 to 4294967295 and wrap around;

   *  Stream ID is constrained to values from 0 to 16777215 inclusive.



Thornburgh                    Informational                     [Page 8]

                         RTMP Errata and Addenda               June 2023


   Note that in some cases these constraints are more restrictive than
   the facilities provided by lower-layer transports.  For example, RTMP
   Chunk Stream could encode a Stream ID up to 4294967295; RTMFP could
   encode a Stream ID of any finite non-negative integer (though typical
   implementations are limited to 2^64 - 1) and transport messages of
   unlimited length.  However, exceeding the limits enumerated above
   will impede interoperability and protocol translation, so they SHOULD
   NOT be exceeded.

6.1.  Alternative Transports and Processing Possible

   RTMP Chunk Stream is not the only possible transport service for RTMP
   Messages.  This flexibility is stated in several places.  For
   example:

   |  The [sic] section specifies the format of RTMP messages that are
   |  transferred between entities on a network using a lower level
   |  transport layer, such as RTMP Chunk Stream.  While RTMP was
   |  designed to work with the RTMP Chunk Stream, it can send the
   |  messages using any other transport protocol.  (Section 6 of
   |  [RTMP])

   |  Real-time streaming network communication for the Flash platform
   |  of video, audio, and data typically uses Adobe's Real-Time
   |  Messaging Protocol (RTMP) messages.  RTMP messages were originally
   |  designed to be transported over RTMP Chunk Stream in TCP; however,
   |  other transports (such as the one described in this memo) are
   |  possible.  (Section 1 of [RFC7425])

   |  The Flash platform uses RTMP messages for media streaming and
   |  communication.  This section describes how to transport RTMP
   |  messages over RTMFP flows and additional messages and semantics
   |  unique to this transport.  (Section 5 of [RFC7425])

   This flexibility is memorialized here.

   Note well that during ordinary processing, RTMP Messages can be
   translated between different protocols and can pass through
   heterogeneous processing elements, which can mask, confound, or
   destroy message meta-information beyond the Message Virtual Header
   (such as the Chunk Stream ID or RTMFP flow on which a message
   originally arrived).  Different processing elements can apply
   different treatments, policies, priorities, and deadlines to RTMP
   message streams, potentially affecting message arrival, arrival
   order, and interarrival timing.

6.2.  Object Encoding 3

   When objectEncoding 3 is negotiated during connect (Section 7.1.1),
   Type 17 Command Extended and Type 15 Data Extended messages can be
   used to carry AMF 3 [AMF3] coded values.

   Section 7.1.1 of [RTMP] implies that a Type 17 Command Extended
   message is a sequence of AMF 3 coded values.  Likewise, Section 7.1.2
   of [RTMP] implies that a Type 15 Data Extended message is a sequence
   of AMF 3 coded values.  These implications are incorrect.

   A Type 17 Command Extended or Type 15 Data Extended message payload
   begins with a format selector byte, followed by a sequence of values
   in a format-specific encoding.  Currently only format 0 is defined;
   therefore, the format selector byte MUST be 0.  Format 0 is a
   sequence of AMF values, each encoded in AMF 0 by default; AMF 3
   encoding for a value is selected by prefixing it with an avmplus-
   object-marker (byte 0x11) as defined in [AMF0].

   Type 20 Command messages and Type 18 Data messages comprise a
   sequence of AMF 0 coded values, as originally implied.

7.  Remote Procedure Call

7.1.  connect

   Section 7.2.1.1 of [RTMP] lists parameters for the connect command
   and their potential values or ranges.  However, that section contains
   incomplete and misleading information particularly in capability
   negotiation.

7.1.1.  objectEncoding Negotiation

   The objectEncoding property of the connect command's Command Object
   is OPTIONAL with a default value of 0.  If given, the possible values
   are 0 and 3 (Numbers).  This value indicates the Object Encoding
   methods supported by the client.  A value of 0 indicates support only
   for AMF 0 and the Type 20 Command and Type 18 Data message types.  A
   value of 3 indicates support for both AMF 0 and AMF 3, and for Type
   17 Command Extended and Type 15 Data Extended messages in addition to
   Type 20 and Type 18 messages.  See Section 6.2 for the corrected
   encoding of these message types.

   The server responds with the highest legal value that both it and the
   client support (that is, the server MUST NOT send 3 if the client
   didn't send 3).  Some clients require this property in the _result,
   so the server SHOULD send it.  If Object Encoding 0 is negotiated,
   client and server MUST NOT send Command Extended or Data Extended
   messages to each other.  If Object Encoding 3 is negotiated, client
   and server can use either the normal (Type 20 and Type 18) or
   extended (Type 17 and Type 15) message types at any time.

   Interoperability Note: The connect command SHOULD be sent in a Type
   20 Command message unless the client has prior knowledge that the
   server to which it is connecting supports Object Encoding 3.

7.1.2.  tcUrl

   The tcUrl property of the connect command's Command Object is
   REQUIRED.  Its value is a string representing the URI to which the
   client is connecting.  Contrary to Section 7.2.1.1 of [RTMP], RTMP
   family URIs follow the generic syntax for URIs [RFC3986].  The
   hierarchical path component and optional query component identify the
   _target resource_ within the server's namespace.

   The meaning of "target resource" is implementation specific and is
   reserved for the server.

   Per Security Considerations (Section 9), the client SHOULD strip any
   userinfo and fragment components from the URI before sending it.

   Interoperability Note: Some clients improperly presume the server's
   interpretation of the path component of the URI, rewriting it and
   using one or more segments of the original path for a non-connection
   purpose such as the name of a stream to play or publish.  This
   behavior is not interoperable and is NOT RECOMMENDED.  A
   recommendation of an alternative is beyond the purview of this memo;
   however, the community might consider more semantically appropriate
   alternatives, for example using the fragment component to indicate
   client-side parameters and behaviors such as the name of a stream to
   play or publish.

7.1.3.  app

   The app property of the connect command's Command Object is REQUIRED.
   Its value is a string indicating the _target application resource_ to
   which the client is connecting.  Unless the client has prior
   knowledge to the contrary of the server's specific implementation,
   app SHOULD be set to the path component of the URI to which the
   client is connecting, not including the leading slash (if any).

   The meaning of "target application resource" is implementation
   specific and is reserved for the server.

7.1.4.  Codec Negotiation

   The videoCodecs and audioCodecs properties of the connect command's
   Command Object are bit fields representing the video and audio
   codecs, respectively, that the client is capable and willing to
   receive.  These properties are OPTIONAL and each defaults to 0 (that
   is, no bits set, so no codecs indicated).  The values for these
   fields are enumerated in Section 7.2.1.1 of [RTMP]; multiple codecs
   are combined with bitwise-or.

                         RTMP Errata and Addenda               June 2023


   Interoperability Note: Some server implementations, including Adobe
   Media Server, use this information to selectively filter out Video
   and Audio messages having codecs not indicated in the respective bit
   fields.  In other words, some servers might not send the video and/or
   audio messages of certain streams unless these properties are sent
   with appropriate values.  Therefore, clients SHOULD send videoCodecs
   and audioCodecs in the connect command indicating at least their
   supported playback codecs.

7.2.  call

   Section 7.2.1.2 of [RTMP], in context, conflates the call method on a
   NetConnection ActionScript object (specific to Flash Player and Adobe
   Integrated Runtime) with the encoding of a general Remote Procedure
   Call into an RTMP Command message.  This conflation has caused
   confusion for some implementers.  The command structure illustrated
   in that section is correct.  In particular, the name of the remote
   procedure to invoke on the peer is given as the first field (as
   illustrated), and the string "call" does not appear in the command
   message sent to the peer.

7.3.  deleteStream

   Section 7.2.2.3 of [RTMP] erroneously states that the deleteStream
   command is a _"NetStream"_ command.  The deleteStream command is
   actually a _"NetConnection"_ command (like connect and createStream)
   and is to be sent on Message Stream ID 0 (the "control stream").  The
   Message Stream ID being deleted is sent as the fourth field of the
   command message, as indicated.

8.  IANA Considerations

   This memo has no IANA actions.

9.  Security Considerations

   RTMP and RTMFP URIs use the generic syntax for URIs [RFC3986].  URIs
   can encode sensitive or private information such as user names,
   passwords, stream names, and so on.  Implementations SHOULD remove
   any userinfo and fragment components of a URI before sending it as
   the tcUrl property of the connect command's Command Object or in the
   Ancillary Data option of an RTMFP Endpoint Discriminator
   (Section 4.4.2.2 of [RFC7425]).
