   network protocols for transporting streams of time-oriented video,
   audio, and data messages over IP networks.  The URI schemes that are
   used to identify, locate, and access streaming resources in the RTMP
   family follow the URI Generic Syntax of RFC 3986, with constraints.

1.  Introduction

   Adobe’s Real-Time Messaging Protocol (RTMP) comprises a family of
   network protocols for transporting streams of time-oriented video,
   audio, and data messages over IP networks.

   The URI schemes that are used to identify, locate, and access
   streaming resources in the RTMP family follow the URI Generic Syntax
   of [RFC3986], with constraints.

   RTMP and its TCP-based transport (the RTMP Chunk Stream) are
   described in the RTMP Specification of December 2012 [RTMP].  Errors,
   omissions, and ambiguities in that specification are addressed in
   RTMP Errata and Addenda [RTMP-Errata].  Coordinated interoperable
   enhancements to RTMP are described in Enhanced RTMP [E-RTMP].
   Transporting RTMP messages over the Secure Real-Time Media Flow
   Protocol (RTMFP) [RFC7016] is described in Adobe's RTMFP Profile for
   Flash Communication [RFC7425].

   This memo describes the syntax constraints and the access semantics
   for RTMP family URIs.

   This memo does not address private or undocumented extensions to the
   RTMP family for which interoperation is not desired by the extending
   parties.

   The primary operation for dereferencing an RTMP family URI is to
   connect to the indicated origin server and its abstract _target
   resource_. Neither the connection itself nor the target resource have
   a "representation" or a "media type" in the senses described in RFC
   3986, nor is a "retrieval" performed by connecting.

                                RTMP URIs                      July 2024


   The target resource can have secondary resources, such as streams,
   shared objects, and remote procedures, that can be accessed according
   their kinds via the connection.  For example, streams may be
   published or played, shared objects updated or observed, and remote
   procedures called.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   The terms "client", "server", "origin server", "resource", "secondary
   resource", "dereference", "representation", and "media type" in this
   document are to be interpreted as used or described in [RFC3986].

3.  Syntax

   RTMP family URIs follow the Generic Syntax of [RFC3986], with
   constraints.  Their syntax is described here using the Augmented
   Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) [RFC5234] rules from RFC 3986, which are
   incorporated by reference as though fully set forth here.  The host
   rule is also reproduced here for clarity in the following sections.
   Note that the rtmp-authority rule defined here is compatible with the
   authority rule, and rtmp-userinfo is compatible with the userinfo
   rule.

   rtmp-URI  = "rtmp://" common

   rtmps-URI = "rtmps://" common

   rtmfp-URI = "rtmfp:" ["//" common]

   common = rtmp-authority path-abempty ["?" query] ["#" fragment]

   rtmp-authority   = [rtmp-userinfo "@"] host [":" port]

   rtmp-userinfo    = rtmp-connect-arg *(":" rtmp-connect-arg)

   rtmp-connect-arg = *(unreserved / pct-encoded / sub-delims)

   host = IP-literal / IPv4address / reg-name

                                RTMP URIs                      July 2024


4.  Authority

   The rtmp-authority component, when present, identifies the location
   of an RTMP origin server which governs a namespace of target and
   secondary resources.

   Note: The bare RTMFP URI form "rtmfp:" does not have an rtmp-
   authority component (or any other components).  All of the other URI
   forms do.  The bare "rtmfp:" URI is used in the APIs of some
   implementations to indicate instantiation of an RTMFP client
   according to [RFC7425], but without connecting to a server.  Such an
   instantiation might be used for pure peer-to-peer communication.

4.1.  Host and Port

   The host and optional port components locate the origin server in the
   network.  The host component of the rtmp-authority MUST NOT be empty.

   For an rtmp-URI, the host and optional port identify a potential
   origin server listening for TCP [RFC0793] connections, over which
   RTMP messages are to be sent using the RTMP Chunk Stream as described
   in the RTMP Specification [RTMP].  If the port is empty or not given,
   TCP port 1935 is the default.

   For an rtmps-URI, the host and optional port identify a potential
   origin server listening for TCP connections and capable of
   establishing a TLS [RFC8446] connection secured for RTMP Chunk Stream
   communication [RTMP].  "Secured" means a connection that is
   authenticated, confidential, and integrity-protected in a manner
   acceptable to both the client and server.  If the port is empty or
   not given, TCP port 443 is the default.

   For an rtmfp-URI where the rtmp-authority is present, the host and
   optional port identify one or more initial candidate addresses with
   which to initiate an RTMFP [RFC7016] connection according to
   [RFC7425].  The UDP [RFC0768] port for the initial candidate
   addresses, if empty or not specified, is 1935.  If host is a reg-
   name, the initial candidate address set SHOULD comprise all IPv4 and
   IPv6 addresses to which reg-name resolves.

4.2.  Userinfo

   When connecting to an RTMP server, the connect command
   (Section 7.2.1.1 of [RTMP]) can accept or expect additional arguments
   following the _Command Object_. The number and types of the
   additional arguments, their interpretation, and whether they are
   expected is implementation-specific and is the prerogative of the
   server.



Thornburgh                    Informational                     [Page 4]

                                RTMP URIs                      July 2024


   Often the server expects one or more string arguments to the connect
   command following the _Command Object_, for example a developer key,
   a user name and password, or implementation-specific connection
   properties.

   If the rtmp-authority contains an rtmp-userinfo component, and in the
   absence of other arrangements between the client and server, the
   rtmp-userinfo SHOULD be interpreted as a ":" (COLON) separated
   sequence of potentially empty rtmp-connect-arg strings (as
   illustrated in the ABNF) to be sent as string arguments to the
   connect command following the _Command Object_. Each rtmp-connect-arg
   SHOULD be percent-decoded before being sent.

   Clients SHOULD remove the rtmp-userinfo component from the URI when
   sending it as the tcUrl property of the connect command’s _Command
   Object_ or in the Ancillary Data option of an RTMFP Endpoint
   Discriminator (Section 4.4.2.2 of [RFC7425]).

5.  Path and Query

   The path-abempty and query components identify the abstract _target
   resource_ within the origin server’s namespace.  The meaning of
   "target resource" is implementation-specific and is the prerogative
   of the origin server.

   Interoperability Note: Some client implementations incorrectly
   presume the server’s interpretation of the path-abempty component of
   the URI, specifically by presuming the number of path segments that
   identify the target resource.  These clients then incorrectly
   interpret the remaining path segments of the original URI as
   identifying a secondary resource (such as the name of a stream to
   play or publish via the connection to the target resource).  This
   behavior is not in keeping with the spirit of URIs (particularly that
   the authority governs its namespace), is not interoperable, and is
   NOT RECOMMENDED.  Such secondary resources, when encoded in a URI,
   should instead be identified by the fragment identifier as described
   in the next section.

6.  Fragment Identifier

   Section 3.5 of [RFC3986] describes the fragment component of a
   generic URI as allowing "indirect identification of a secondary
   resource by reference to a primary resource and additional
   identifying information".

   Since an RTMP connection to a target resource has neither a
   "representation" nor a "media type", the semantics of the fragment
   component are unconstrained according to that section.

                                RTMP URIs                      July 2024


   Often an RTMP client connects to a server to perform a specific
   operation on a specific secondary resource, such as to publish to or
   play from a named stream.  In cases where the kind of secondary
   resource and the intended operation are unambiguous, and in the
   absence of other arrangements between the client and server, the
   secondary resource MAY be identified by the fragment component.  The
   fragment SHOULD be percent-decoded before being used in secondary
   resource APIs (for example in a stream play command).

   Clients SHOULD remove the fragment component from the URI when
   sending it as the tcUrl property of the connect command’s _Command
   Object_ or in the Ancillary Data option of an RTMFP Endpoint
   Discriminator (Section 4.4.2.2 of [RFC7425]).

8.  IANA Considerations

   A future version of this memo will request of the IANA to update the
   URI Scheme Registry [SCHEMES] for the following schemes.

8.1.  RTMP Registration

   This section will request an update to the rtmp provisional scheme
   registration.

   Scheme Name:  rtmp

   Status:  provisional

   URI scheme syntax:
      rtmp-URI = "rtmp://" common

      common = rtmp-authority path-abempty ["?" query] ["#" fragment]

      rtmp-authority   = [rtmp-userinfo "@"] host [":" port]



Thornburgh                    Informational                     [Page 6]

                                RTMP URIs                      July 2024


      rtmp-userinfo    = rtmp-connect-arg *(":" rtmp-connect-arg)

      rtmp-connect-arg = *(unreserved / pct-encoded / sub-delims)

   URI scheme semantics:  This provides location information for the
      RTMP server to which to connect, and identifies a target resource
      and an optional secondary resource in the namespace of the server.
      The host component of the authority MUST NOT be empty.  The host
      and optional port components of the authority identify a potential
      origin server listening for TCP connections, over which RTMP
      messages are to be sent using the RTMP Chunk Stream as described
      in the RTMP Specification (as amended).  If port is empty or not
      given, TCP port 1935 is the default.

      See the RTMP Family URI Schemes memo for more specific information
      regarding the semantics of this URI scheme.

   Encoding considerations:  The rtmp-userinfo, path-abempty, query, and
      fragment components represent textual data consisting of
      characters from the Universal Character Set. These components
      SHOULD be encoded according to Section 2.5 of RFC 3986.

   Applications/protocols that use this URI scheme name:  Computer
      program products that use Adobe's Real-Time Messaging Protocol
      (RTMP) to transport streams of time-oriented video, audio, and
      data messages over IP networks.

   Interoperability considerations:  This scheme requires use of RTMP
      and the RTMP Chunk Stream as defined by the RTMP Specification (as
      amended).

   Security considerations:  See the Security Considerations sections in
      RTMP Errata and Addenda and in RTMP Family URI Schemes.

8.2.  RTMPS Registration

   This section will request provisional registration of the rtmps
   scheme.

   Scheme Name:  rtmps

   Status:  provisional

   URI scheme syntax:
      rtmps-URI = "rtmps://" common

      common = rtmp-authority path-abempty ["?" query] ["#" fragment]

      rtmp-authority   = [rtmp-userinfo "@"] host [":" port]

      rtmp-userinfo    = rtmp-connect-arg *(":" rtmp-connect-arg)

      rtmp-connect-arg = *(unreserved / pct-encoded / sub-delims)

   URI scheme semantics:  This provides location information for the
      secure RTMP server to which to connect, and identifies a target
      resource and an optional secondary resource in the namespace of
      the server.  The host component of the authority MUST NOT be
      empty.  The host and optional port components of the authority
      identify a potential origin server listening for TCP connections
      and capable of establishing a TLS connection secured for RTMP
      Chunk Stream communication, over which RTMP messages are to be
      sent using the RTMP Chunk Stream as described in the RTMP
      Specification (as amended).  If port is empty or not given, TCP
      port 443 is the default.

      See the RTMP Family URI Schemes memo for more specific information
      regarding the semantics of this URI scheme.

   Encoding considerations:  The rtmp-userinfo, path-abempty, query, and
      fragment components represent textual data consisting of
      characters from the Universal Character Set. These components
      SHOULD be encoded according to Section 2.5 of RFC 3986.

   Applications/protocols that use this URI scheme name:  Computer
      program products that use Adobe's Real-Time Messaging Protocol
      (RTMP) to securely transport streams of time-oriented video,
      audio, and data messages over IP networks.

   Interoperability considerations:  This scheme requires use of RTMP
      and the RTMP Chunk Stream as defined by the RTMP Specification (as
      amended) over TLS.

8.3.  RTMFP Registration

   This section will request an update to the rtmfp provisional scheme
   registration.

   Scheme Name:  rtmfp

   Status:  provisional

   URI scheme syntax:
      rtmfp-URI = "rtmfp:" ["//" common]

      common = rtmp-authority path-abempty ["?" query] ["#" fragment]

      rtmp-authority   = [rtmp-userinfo "@"] host [":" port]

      rtmp-userinfo    = rtmp-connect-arg *(":" rtmp-connect-arg)

      rtmp-connect-arg = *(unreserved / pct-encoded / sub-delims)

   URI scheme semantics:  The scheme-only form is used in the APIs of
      some implementations to indicate instantiation of an RTMFP client
      according to RFC 7425, but without connecting to a server.  Such
      an instantiation might be used for pure peer-to-peer
      communication.

      The full form provides location information for the RTMFP server
      to which to connect, and identifies a target resource and an
      optional secondary resource in the namespace of the server.
      Connections are made using RTMFP (RFC 7016) as described by RFC

      7425.  The host component of the authority MUST NOT be empty.  If
      host is a reg-name, the initial candidate address set SHOULD
      comprise all IPv4 and IPv6 addresses to which reg-name resolves.
      The UDP port for the initial candidate addresses for the server,
      if not specified, is 1935.

      See the RTMP Family URI Schemes memo for more specific information
      regarding the semantics of this URI scheme.

   Encoding considerations:  The rtmp-userinfo, path-abempty, query, and
      fragment components represent textual data consisting of
      characters from the Universal Character Set. These components
      SHOULD be encoded according to Section 2.5 of RFC 3986.

   Applications/protocols that use this URI scheme name:  Computer
      program products that use Adobe's Secure Real-Time Media Flow
      Protocol (RTMFP) according to RFC 7425 to transport streams of
      time-oriented video, audio, and data messages over IP networks.

   Interoperability considerations:  This scheme requires use of RTMFP
      as defined by RFC 7016 in the manner described by RFC 7425.
