RTMP Family URI Schemes
=======================
Adobeâ€™s Real-Time Messaging Protocol (RTMP) comprises a family of network
protocols for transporting streams of time-oriented video, audio, and data
messages over IP networks. The URI schemes that are used to identify, locate,
and access streaming resources in the RTMP family follow the URI Generic
Syntax of [RFC 3986][], with constraints.

This memo describes the syntax constraints and the access semantics for RTMP
family URIs. It is available in the following formats:

* [HTML](rtmp-uris.html)
* [Plain Text](rtmp-uris.txt)
* [xml2rfc](rtmp-uris.xml) (source format)

This is a [work-in-progress][repo]. Please check back for updates. If you
notice an error, please [open an issue on GitHub][issues].
