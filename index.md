RTMP Errata and Addenda
=======================
The specification for [Adobe's Real-Time Messaging Protocol (RTMP)][RTMP],
last updated in December 2012, contains errors, omissions, and ambiguities
that impede interoperation. The _Errata and Addenda_ document corrects,
clarifies, and amends portions of the RTMP specification.

The _Errata and Addenda_ document is available in the following formats:

* [HTML](rtmp-errata-addenda.html)
* [Plain Text](rtmp-errata-addenda.txt)
* [xml2rfc](rtmp-errata-addenda.xml) (source format)

This is a [work-in-progress][repo]. Please check back for updates. If you
notice an error in the _Errata and Addenda_ document, or if there is an
unaddressed error, omission, or ambiguity in [RTMP][], please
[open an issue on GitHub][issues].

See [RTMP Family URI Schemes](rtmp-uris/) for a formal definition of the
syntax and semantics of the URIs used to identify and locate RTMP streaming
resources.
